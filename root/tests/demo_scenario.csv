Non-stop travel, where you stay on the same plane for the entire journey, is often preferred for its convenience and reduced risk of delays [3]. This is because there's no second take-off or landing, no transfer security point or passport control, and one less plane lowers the odds of issues delaying or canceling your flight [3].,,,,,,,,,,,
