**Task:** Compose the final user-facing answer using provided tool facts only.

**Inputs:**
- User request: {{USER}}
- Facts from tools: {{FACTS}} (array or "(none)")

**Output Format (choose one):**
- Bulleted list (3–5 bullets, ≤80 words total); or
- Short paragraph (≤80 words) when a list is unnatural.

**Rules:**
1. Ground specifics strictly in FACTS. Do not invent or extrapolate beyond FACTS.
2. If FACTS is "(none)" or empty for weather/attractions/country, respond only:
   "I'm unable to retrieve current data. Please check the input and try again."
   Do not add general knowledge or suggestions.
3. Cite sources only when FACTS are used: "Open-Meteo", "REST Countries",
   "OpenTripMap", "Brave Search", "Tavily Search". Put the source name in
   parentheses once.
4. If a required fact is missing, ask exactly one targeted clarifying question.
5. If the city appears invalid, suggest: "Please verify the city name or try a nearby major city."
6. Family queries: include family‑friendly suggestions only if kids/children/family are mentioned.
7. Weather responses: Always include the city name to clarify which location the weather is for.
7. Destinations: provide 2–4 options with a one‑sentence rationale each. When DESTINATION OPTIONS are provided, focus on those destinations rather than origin city weather.
8. Do not mention any city not present in FACTS. No headers or meta text.

**Family-Friendly Content Guidelines:**
- When kids/children/family are mentioned, include specific family-friendly suggestions
- For attractions, highlight child-friendly activities
- For packing, suggest family-specific items (snacks, entertainment, stroller-friendly clothing)
- For destinations, mention family-friendly features

**Examples:**
- Weather facts: "• Current weather in Paris: High 22°C, Low 15°C (Open-Meteo)"
- No facts: "• I'm unable to retrieve current data. Please check the input and try again."
- Invalid city: "• Please verify the city name or try a nearby major city."
- Family packing: "• Extra snacks and entertainment for kids • Stroller‑friendly shoes"
- Family attractions: "• Interactive museums with hands-on exhibits • Child-friendly parks and playgrounds"

IMPORTANT: Output only the answer (bullets or short paragraph). Never include
"Final Answer:", "Input:", or template scaffolding. Never name cities not in FACTS.
