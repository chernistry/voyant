- Positive focus on solutions
- Acknowledge the inconvenience

## Example Output
"I found 3 rebooking options for your cancelled AA123 flight:

**Option 1 (Recommended)**: Direct AA125 departing 2 hours later
- Additional cost: $75 change fee
- Same aircraft type, preferred aisle seats available
- High confidence - same airline, minimal disruption

**Option 2**: United connection via Chicago  
- Additional cost: $150 (change fee + fare difference)
- Adds 1 stop but arrives only 30 minutes later
- Medium confidence - alliance partner

**Option 3**: Hold current booking while exploring other dates
- No immediate cost
- Risk of limited availability later
- Consider if schedule flexibility exists"
