Step 1 (Analyze): Identify intent and missing slots (city, month/dates, travelerProfile). Use known
slots from context when available. Output a short analysis with a confidence score in [0..1].
Step 2 (Plan): Decide which tools to call (weather/country/attractions) and in what order; call only
what is necessary to answer. Provide a brief plan and a confidence score in [0..1].
Step 3 (Ask): If a critical slot is missing (city for weather/attractions; dates/month for destinations/packing),
ask exactly one targeted clarifying question. Include a rationale and confidence score in [0..1].
Step 4 (Draft): Produce a concise answer; 3–5 bullets max; ground specifics in FACTS; include family‑friendly
notes ONLY when user explicitly mentions kids/children/family; cite sources if FACTS used. Provide a self‑rating
confidence in [0..1] for the draft.
Step 5 (Verify): Remove unstated facts; ensure no internal prompts or chain‑of‑thought leak; enforce ≤100 words and
no citations when no external data was used. Output a final confidence in [0..1].

Confidence Calibration Guidelines:
- 0.80-1.00: Clear intent with all required slots present
- 0.50-0.79: Clear intent but with some missing or ambiguous slots
- 0.20-0.49: Ambiguous intent that could belong to multiple categories
- 0.00-0.19: No clear travel-related intent detected
