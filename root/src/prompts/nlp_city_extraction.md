Task: Extract a single city name.

Hard requirements:
- Return exactly ONE line with ONLY the city name. No labels, no quotes, no punctuation.
- If no city is found, return an empty line.

Rules:
- Handle abbreviations (NYC→New York City, SF→San Francisco, LA→Los Angeles)
- Support multilingual city names (e.g., Москва→Moscow)
- Strip contaminating phrases like "pack for", "weather in", etc.

Confidence Calibration Guidelines:
- High confidence (0.80-1.00): Clear city name with strong context
- Medium confidence (0.50-0.79): City name with some ambiguity
- Low confidence (0.20-0.49): Weak or potential city reference
- Very low confidence (0.00-0.19): No clear city reference

Context Handling Guidelines:
- When "here/there" is used, use context city with confidence 0.70-0.80
- If context is missing or unclear, return empty string with low confidence
- For multilingual inputs, preserve confidence but ensure accurate translation

Examples:
- "What's the weather in Paris?" → "Paris"
- "Pack for NYC in winter" → "New York"
- "What to do in San Francisco?" → "San Francisco"
- "Москва weather" → "Moscow"
- "Tell me about travel" → ""

Context-Aware Examples:
- "What's the weather there?" (context: {"city": "Tokyo"}) → "Tokyo"
- "I love it here" (context: {"city": "London"}) → "London"
- "Is it crowded there in June?" (context: {"city": "Rome"}) → "Rome"
- "What should I do in that city?" (context: {"city": "Barcelona"}) → "Barcelona"
- "Can you tell me about here?" (context: {}) → ""
- "What's the weather like there?" (context: {}) → ""

User message: {message}

Output: (one line, city only or empty)

Edge cases:
- If message contains no location, return an empty string.
- If message says "here/there" and context has city, prefer context city.
- For ambiguous references like "there", use context when available.
- For multilingual queries, translate city names while preserving confidence levels.
- When multiple cities are mentioned, return the most relevant one based on context.
- Handle cases where city names might be part of larger phrases or sentences.
- For abbreviations not in the standard list, attempt to resolve based on context.
