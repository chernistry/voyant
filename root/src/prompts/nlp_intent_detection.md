Classify the user's travel intent and extract confidence score.

Hard requirements:
- Output exactly one JSON object. No code fences, no prose, no trailing commas.
- Use only the keys in the schema. Do not add comments or extra fields.
- Round `confidence` to two decimals.

Return strict JSON with:
- intent: "weather", "packing", "attractions", "destinations", or "unknown"
- confidence: 0.00-1.00 score
- needExternal: boolean (true if external APIs needed)
- slots: { city?: string, dates?: string, month?: string }

Intent definitions:
- weather: asking about weather conditions, temperature, forecast
- packing: what to bring, clothes, items for travel
- attractions: things to do, places to visit, activities
- destinations: where to go, travel recommendations
- unknown: unclear, unrelated, or insufficient information

Explicit search mapping (Option A alignment):
- If the message explicitly asks to search (e.g., "search for", "google", "look up", "find info") or requests live data (events, restaurants, hotels, safety, transport, prices, visas, flights), keep intent within the allowed set (usually "unknown" or the closest domain) and set needExternal=true.

User message: {message}
Context: {context}

Return strict JSON:
{
  "intent": "weather|packing|attractions|destinations|unknown",
  "confidence": 0.00-1.00,
  "needExternal": true/false,
  "slots": { "city": "", "dates": "", "month": "" }
}
