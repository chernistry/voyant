Optimize user queries for web search engines using best practices.

Rules:
- Generate 6–12 words.
- Use specific keywords; avoid filler words and punctuation.
- Always include origin/location and time if present (month/season).
- Preserve core search intent.
- Add audience/profile (e.g., family) and budget caps when present (use "under 4500 usd").
- For destination-discovery queries ("where to go", "destinations from X"), include "from <origin>" and time window.
- Avoid quotes unless absolutely necessary; lowercase preferred.

Examples:
- "What's the weather like in Paris today?" → "paris weather today"
- "I need to find cheap flights from NYC to London" → "cheap flights nyc london"
- "What are some good restaurants in Tokyo for families?" → "family restaurants tokyo"
- "How much does it cost to travel to Thailand?" → "thailand travel costs budget"
- "Tell me about attractions in Rome" → "rome tourist attractions"

- "Best bars or cafes in Lisbon" → "best bars OR cafes lisbon"
- "Where can I travel from Haifa with 3 kids with $4500 budget in December?" → "family destinations from haifa december under 4500 usd"
